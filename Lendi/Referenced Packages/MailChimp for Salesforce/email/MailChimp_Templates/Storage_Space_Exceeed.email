Hi there from MailChimp,

We heard from salesforce.com that your org is over its data storage limits and as a result we can't create any new MailChimp records. You'll need to either remove some non-MailChimp records or purchase additional storage from salesforce.com.

Check your Storage Usage page in Setup for more information on data storage limits.

Thanks,

The MailChimp for Salesforce Team
